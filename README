                                               REQUIREMENTS
============================================================

This software was developed and tested with Perl v5.12.4 on 
Mac OS X 10.8.4, but any version of Perl 5 will work.

The following Perl modules are required:

  Getopt::Long
  Pod::Usage
  File::Find
  File::Spec

And the following are optional:

  Term::ReadKey

All of these packages are available for free from the CPAN
module archive (http://www.cpan.org/).

                                               INSTALLATION
============================================================

** No installation is necessary. **

(optional) To install the script system-wide for all users,
you can enable execute permissions and copy the file to a 
directory in your user's shell PATH:

  > chmod +x pccp-VERSION.pl
  > cp pccp-VERSION.pl /usr/local/bin

  To see what directories are in your PATH:

    > echo $PATH

  I also recommend renaming the file or creating a symlink
  when installing the script system-wide:

    > cd /usr/local/bin
    > mv pccp-VERSION.pl pccp

      - OR -
    
    > cd /usr/local/bin
    > ln -s pccp-VERSION.pl pccp

============================================================
                                                      USAGE
============================================================

To view the built-in POD-generated man page:

  > perl pccp-VERSION.pl --manpage
